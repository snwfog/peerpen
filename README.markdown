### Setting up a Tomcat web application project in IntelliJ

Without generalizing, here is the folder structure that you are suppose to see when opening up (or importing in) the project into IntelliJ.

Then make sure that you have the project structure setup properly. It should be setup already technically, since that the `iml` file is sync'ed with `git`.

To verify the project structure, you click on `File -> Project Structure`:

Make sure that the `ppar` library is included in the compile path:

Make sure that the artifact deployment section is setup, if it is empty, just add a new project and choose to have a exploded `war`.

Add a new server deployment, it should be your local Tomcat repository. This step might be optional, depending on your system.
